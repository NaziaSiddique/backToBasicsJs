// 1. Create an object that has properties "username" and "password". Fill those values in with strings.

let user = {
    username: 'Nazia',
    password: 'Secr3t'
}

// 2. Create an array which contains the object you have made above and name the array "database".

const database = [
    {
        username: 'Nazia',
        password: 'Secr3t'
    }
];

// 3. Create an array called "newsfeed" which contains 3 objects with properties "username" and "timeline".

const newsfeed = [
    {
        username: 'Tom',
        timeline: 'Hey, I am tired'
    },
    {
        username: 'Jon',
        timeline: 'I am happy'
